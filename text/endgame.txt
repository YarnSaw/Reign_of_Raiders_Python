Dean: Ray you there? Whats happening?
Ray: a little late for you to be offering help... I just defeated the captain.
Dean: you what?!? seriously?
Ray: Yes. But I also have some bad news.
Ray: when i found the captian, he told me that he hid the gold somewhere else
Ray: There is almost no gold anywhere to  be found here!
Dean: I guess we will just have to rob    more banks until we find it.
Dean: good job defeating the captain.     Come back to the base now, we can look   for the gold soon.
