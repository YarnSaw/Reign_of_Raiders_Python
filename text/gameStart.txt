A town that once lived in peace...
Now lies in ruins...  
In 202X, somewhere, somewhere in this     world...
Technology advanced much faster than ever thought possible.
With this change, the world could become  much more civilized, where everyone can  have a home and food to eat.
However, things dont always work out that way...
In the hands of the unworthy...
Anything good can become a weapon of mass destruction.
But thats okay...
All you desire is money, and with this newtechnology...
you can finally get all the money you     desire
