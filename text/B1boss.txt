Captain: So you're the little runt that   thinks they can rob from my banks
Captain: All these banks are under my     protection. You will not succeed.
Captain: If you go back now, i'll considernot killing you.
Ray: Thanks for the offer, but i think i  will pass
Captain: That will be a grave mistake...
Ray: I've made many mistakes, yet i am    still here
Captain: You are barely worthy of my      notice. I wonder how you even made it    this far. 
Captain: These guards will be more than   enough to deal with you.
Captain: If not, I will deal with you     personally in Scotiabank stronghold.
