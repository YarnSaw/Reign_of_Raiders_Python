Dean: Do you want to memorize  everything right now?
Ray: Nope
Dean: Then I suggest that you stick to my plan.
Although Im not very good at carrying themout, my plans are formulated in a very   strategic manner.
Ray: That sounds reasonable. Lets do this!
Dean: I also suggest that you dont enter  with your gun drawn. You dont want to    draw too much attention to yourself.
Dean: Once you hurt a civilian or police  officer a timer will start.  That is how long until the SWAT team to arrive.
Ray: What does SWAT stand for anyways?
Dean: If I remember correctly, it stands  for Suited Workers Attacking Trees
Ray: That doesnt make any sense
Dean: Then I didnt remember it correctly
